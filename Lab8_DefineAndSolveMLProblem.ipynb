    "For this project, I decided to use the Census Income Data. The goal is to predict whether someone makes over 50K a year based on things like their age, education, job, and hours worked per week. This is a supervised machine learning problem because we already know the income labels in the data, and it’s specifically a binary classification problem since the outcome is either over or under 50K. Some of the features is to include workclass, education level, marital status, occupation, and hours per week. I think this is an interesting and important problem because being able to predict income can help companies make better decisions—like tailoring services to different income groups or helping financial institutions understand risk. As a student, I think it's a great way to learn how data can actually be used to make predictions about real people’s lives."

To further improve performance, I applied Random Forest with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and finally used a Stacking Classifier to combine the strengths of multiple models.\n",
